This project involved the creation of mutliple different Java programs that communicated with one another to create an interactive simulation of a controllable remote controlled lunar lander. The task of this assignment was to optimise the code provided as part of the skeleton code in order to improve runtime efficiency as well as to facilitate multithreaded communication between the various programs within the project in order to allow for communication between the lunar lander, it's controller, and all other code aspects of the project.
