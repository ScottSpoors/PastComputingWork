This project was my first major collaborative video game development assignment, in which myself and a group of 4 others developed a concept/demo for a 3D platformer. I was responsible for the creation of the majority of in-game coding, so all code seen in the games files was directly written by myself other than the enemy AI and Unreal Engine starter content, as the other team members took on more design/documentation focused roles.
