The files and projects within this repository represent a series of examples of past software design/development projects I have been involved in. These have been separated partially by field (e.g. Web App Development projects are separated from Game Development work, but each folder may contain examples of applications using multiple different programming languages).

All efforts have been taken to include installation/setup information for projects where required but if any of the work requires clarification please contact me at scott.spoors@outlook.com.

All code present is bespoke and self-developed unless stated otherwise.
