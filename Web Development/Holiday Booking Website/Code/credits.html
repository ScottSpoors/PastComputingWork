	<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
	<p>When developing a holiday booking site such as the site for Leading Choice Getaways, there are many potential security risks that should be taken into account. For instance, during the booking process, the customer will be required to enter potentially sensitive personal information, such as their address and bank details, therefore the site should at all times comply to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the privacy and integrity of all data entered into the site by all users. In addition to this, any sensitive data passed into the site through a form should be done so using the 'post' method, rather than the 'get' method, in order to ensure that the data is better protected when being transferred.</p>
	<p>It would also be encouraged to add a user verification system for the admin page, to ensure that only admin users would have the ability to add new holidays to the database. User accounts should all require passwords to access, and these passwords should always be encrypted when stored on a database and never stored in plaintext. In addition, to access the website the secure protocol HTTPS should be used rather than the standard, less secure HTTP, which would mean an extra layer of security would be provided to the users' connections to the site.</p>
