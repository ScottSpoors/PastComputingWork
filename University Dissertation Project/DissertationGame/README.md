This is the game demo project I created as a part of my dissertation to be used as a user research material for participants to play and give feedback on their gameplay experience, with emphasis on the DDA system. The project was developed in Unreal Engine 4.26 utilising starter content assets due to the time contstraints of development and the demonstrative nature of the required demo.
